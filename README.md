- 👋 Hi, I’m Jiahua (佳华).
- 👀 I’m interested in using reflected Global Navigation Satellite System signals (GNSS-R) to monitor the changes in permafrost areas in polar regions and Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to process raw GNSS-R data.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on GNSS-R related projects.
